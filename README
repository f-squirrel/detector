This is a very simple face\object detector.
It is designed using opencv and boost.

Currently it is available only for Windows OS.

To build it you need do next preparations:
1. install MS Visual C++ 2010
2. Set environment variable:
OPENCV == <drive letter>:\openCV\opencv
BOOST == <drive letter>:\boost\boost_<current version>
For example this is my configuration:
d:\openCV\opencv
d:\boost\boost_1_49_0
3. Both libs should be precompiled
